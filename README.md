### Todo App

We are converting our React ToDo app we did earlier in the course to pull information from our own API, not stored locally in a file and state.

#### Lab

* Setup and run a server (port 8080)
* Setup a route for returning our Todo array of objects
* Update our React App to do a fetch request to get the initial todos
* Remove our STORE.js on our client (initial todos)

### Homework

* Add routes on server for editing and adding new todos
* Update our React app to do fetch requests to update server todos data (edit, post and read)
* So anytime you need to refresh your data to put in state it will do a fetch request.# CIS213-week9
