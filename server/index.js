 HOMEWORK

  /server

  1. create a route for editing posts (complete and edit text)
  2. create a route to delete a post
  
  /client

  1. Add appropriate fetch requests to make your todo app to use data from our server
     whenever we need updated data: adding, editing or deleting or initial read

     Example:

        a. initial read - do a fetch
        b. add a post - get data from user, do a post request, have the server add to server todos object
           and return and updated todos array
        c. edit a post (complete or edit text) - get updates from user, do a put request, have the server
           update the todos object and return back the updated todos array
